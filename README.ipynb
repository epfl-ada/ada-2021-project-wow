    "Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Somehow, to this day there are many in the western society that shy away from defining themselves as pro-feminists, and many even oppose it. In fact, feminism is still a very controversial and politicized topic.\n",
    "In this project, we aim to shed a light on the evolution of feminism between 2015 and 2020 and its relation with the media, using the Quotebank dataset. In particular, we would like to analyze the media coverage that feminism is receiving, both in terms of volume and sentiment. Furthermore, we will try to understand whether feminism is also being applied in practice, by looking at the female / male ratio of speakers and comparing the sentiment that is associated to female and male figures."

This will provide extra information about the speakers, like the gender, necessary for some of the suggested analyses. The available data contains additional medatada on ~9M unique Wikidata entities and are stored in a ``.parquet`` file which can be loaded as a pandas dataframe. As this file contains attributes in terms of ``QIDs`` and are thus uninterpretable by humans, we need to map them to meaningful labels by using an available ``.csv`` file. "
