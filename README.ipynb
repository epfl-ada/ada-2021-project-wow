    "Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Somehow, to this day there are many in the western society that shy away from defining themselves as pro-feminists, and many even oppose it. In fact, feminism is still a very controversial and politicized topic.\n",
    "In this project, we aim to shed a light on the evolution of feminism between 2015 and 2020 and its relation with the media, using the Quotebank dataset. In particular, we would like to analyze the media coverage that feminism is receiving, both in terms of volume and sentiment. Furthermore, we will try to understand whether feminism is also being applied in practice by each media outlet."

All questions shall be answered two weeks before the deadline, in order to have plenty of time to nicely present the results. The work in the first 3 weeks shall be organized as follows: each question shall be addressed by a pair of two teammates; the first two sets of questions will be answered in the first week and a half, the remaining two sets will be answered by the end of the third week. Below is the resulting list of internal milestones up until project Milestone 3.\n",
